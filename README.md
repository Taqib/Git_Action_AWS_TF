Automating AWS VPC Deployment with EC2 using GitHub Actions and Terraform Cloud
In this lab, you will learn how to automate the deployment of an AWS infrastructure using Terraform and GitHub Actions. The infrastructure includes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a public subnet, an Internet Gateway (IGW), and an EC2 instance. The SSH public key used to access the EC2 instance will be securely managed using GitHub Secrets, and the Terraform state file will be stored in Terraform Cloud to ensure consistency and security across deployments.
